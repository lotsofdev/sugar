 * @name                easeInterval
 * @namespace           shared.function
 * @type                Function
 * @platform            js
 * @status              stable
 * @async
 *
 * This function allows you to call a callback function exactly as the `setInterval` would do but with an easing that you can specify,
 * as well as an `interval` setting to customize how many time your function will be called.
 * By default this function will pass the "easedPercent" that represent the percentage of your passed "duration" with the easing applied on it.
 * With that you can make everything you want inside your callback function.
 *
 * @param       {Number}            duration            The duration of your interval process you want
 * @param       {Function}          [cb=null]           A callback function to call at each interval
 * @param       {IEaseIntervalSettings}     [settings={}]       Some settings to customize your interval process
 * @return      {SPromise}                              An SPromise that will be resolved once the process is complete, and through which you can subscribe to the "interval" event that is the same as the "cb" parameter
 *
 * @setting         {Number}        [inteval=1000/25]           An interval in ms to call your callback function
 * @setting         {Function}      [easing=easeInOutQuart]     An easing function that take as parameter a value between 0 and 1
 * @setting         {Number}        [from=0]                    The value to start with
 * @setting         {Number}        [to=100]                    The value to end with
 *
