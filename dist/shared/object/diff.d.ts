 * This function take two objects and return an object that contains only what has been changed between the two.
 * This function is a simple wrapper around the nice object-diff package from Thomas Jensen that you can find here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-diff
 *
 * @param         {Object}          object1            The first object used for the diff process
 * @param         {Object}          object2            The second object used for the diff process
 * @param         {Object}          [settings={}]      An object of settings to configure the diff process:
 * - deep (true) {Boolean}: Specify if you want a deep diff or a simple one level diff
 * - added (true) {Boolean}: Specify if you want to include the props that does not exist on the object1 but exists on the object2
 * - deleted (false) {Boolean}: Specify if you want to include the props that exists on the object1 but no more on the object2
 * - equals (false) {Boolean}: Specify if you want to include the props that are equals from the object1 to the object2
 * - emptyObject (false) {Boolean}: Specify if you want to keep the empty objects in the resulting one
 * - updated (true) {Boolean}: Specify if you want to include the updated values
 * @return        {Object}                             The object that contains only the differences between the two
 *
 * @todo      tests

 * @snippet         __diff($1, $2)
 *
 * @example         js
 * import { __diff } from '@lotsof/sugar/object';
 * const myObject1 = {
 *    hello: 'world',
 *    plop: 'yop'
 * };
 * const myObject2 = {
 *    coco: 'plop',
 *    hello: 'hey!',
 *    plop: 'yop'
 * };
 * __diff(myObject1, myObject2);
 * {
 *    coco: 'plop',
 *    hello: 'hey!'
 * }
